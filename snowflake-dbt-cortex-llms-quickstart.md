- `stg_customer_interactions`: Parsed interaction notes
- `stg_product_reviews`: Structured review data with language detection
- `stg_support_tickets`: Categorized support requests

**Fact Models with AI Enhancement:**
- `fact_customer_interactions`: Interactions with sentiment scores using `SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SENTIMENT`
- `fact_product_reviews`: Reviews with sentiment analysis and automatic translation
- `fact_support_tickets`: Tickets with AI-powered priority scoring

**Analytics Models:**
- `customer_persona_signals`: Comprehensive customer profiles with churn risk and upsell opportunity scoring
- `sentiment_analysis`: Cross-channel sentiment tracking
- `sentiment_trends`: Temporal analysis of customer satisfaction

![dbt Data Transformation Flow](img/dbt-dag.png)

### Verify AI-Enhanced Data

Check that Cortex AI functions are working correctly:

```sql
-- View sentiment-enhanced interactions
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    interaction_notes,
    sentiment_score,
    CASE 
        WHEN sentiment_score > 0.3 THEN 'Positive'
        WHEN sentiment_score < -0.3 THEN 'Negative'
        ELSE 'Neutral'
    END as sentiment_category
FROM DBT_CORTEX_LLMS.ANALYTICS.FACT_CUSTOMER_INTERACTIONS
LIMIT 10;

-- Check multilingual review processing
SELECT 
    review_language,
    review_text,
    review_text_english,

   - Paste it into the semantic model editor in Snowsight
   - The YAML defines all tables, dimensions, measures, and relationships for your customer data

5. **Save the Semantic Model**:
   - Click "Save" to create the semantic model
   - The system will validate the YAML structure and create the semantic model
   - You should see a confirmation that the semantic model was created successfully

> **Alternative Method**: If you prefer using the command line, you can also use the provided script:
> ```bash
> cd streamlit/cortex_analyst
> bash upload_semantic_model.sh
> ```

### Verify Semantic Model

Confirm the semantic model was created successfully:

    ```sql
-- List semantic models
SHOW SEMANTIC MODELS IN SCHEMA DBT_CORTEX_LLMS.SEMANTIC_MODELS;

-- Test with a simple query
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.ANALYST(
    'Show me the top 5 customers by total interactions',
    'DBT_CORTEX_LLMS.SEMANTIC_MODELS.CUSTOMERANALYTICS'
) as analyst_response;
```

The semantic model enables business users to query customer data using natural language like:
- "Which customers have the most negative sentiment?"
- "Show me support ticket trends by category"
- "What are the common themes in product reviews?"
